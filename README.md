# Analysis routine of the Individual Registry of Health Services Benefits (RIPS)

This routine aims to generate the grouping of health events for which people consulted during the years 2018 to 2022, to study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health system care in the different departments of Colombia.

## Content
The repository contains the following:

Data folder: Contains the database provided by the national health ministry, which contains the variables of medical diagnoses (ICD-10) and medical procedures (CUPS) and others referring to patient characteristics such as age, sex and type of insurance.

Scripts folder: Contains some preliminary analyses with which different ways of grouping health events associated with medical consultations were explored, as well as verifications of the CUPS and ICD-10 codes. These steps include estimating an approximate prevalence using the morbidity index proposed by Charlson (Quan et al. in 2005).

Fun folder: This folder contains the function script that performs the analysis routine, from data verification and cleaning, grouping of consultations by health events, and statistical analysis that evaluates the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on them. It also contains the ui.R and server.R files necessary to run the dashboard that displays the main characteristics of the data from medical consultations carried out during the study period.

Output folder: This folder contains all the outputs generated by the routine, such as event groups, graphs, tables, and other result elements.
